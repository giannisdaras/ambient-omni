This repository hosts the official PyTorch implementation of the paper: [Ambient Diffusion Omni: Training Good Models with Bad Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10038)


Authored by: Giannis Daras*, Adrian Rodriguez-Munoz*, Adam Klivans, Antonio Torralba, Constantinos Daskalakis


**Highlights âœ¨**:

- **No filtering required:** Ambient-o achieves strong performance without the need for data filtering or curation, enabling training directly on raw, unfiltered datasets.
- **Better use of synthetic data:** Ambient-o uses synthetic data as noisy data. This has the effect of increasing the output diversity without sacrificing quality or introducing artifacts.
- **Utilizes out-of-distribution images:** Ambient-o can incorporate out-of-distribution (OOD) images during training to improve model performance -- i.e. we show that we can use cats to improve a generative model for dogs.

Our model increases the quality of the generations without any changes in the architecture, training/sampling hyperparameters or the optimization algorithm. The benefit comes solely from using cleverly the available data.

## Text-to-image model

The pre-trained model is available on Hugging Face:
[giannisdaras/ambient-o](https://huggingface.co/giannisdaras/ambient-o).

To use it, you can run the following:

```python
import torch
from micro_diffusion.models.model import create_latent_diffusion
from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download
from safetensors import safe_open

# Init model
params = {
    'latent_res': 64,
    'in_channels': 4,
    'pos_interp_scale': 2.0,
}
model = create_latent_diffusion(**params).to('cuda')

# Download weights from HF
model_dict_path = hf_hub_download(repo_id="giannisdaras/ambient-o", filename="model.safetensors")
model_dict = {}
with safe_open(model_dict_path, framework="pt", device="cpu") as f:
   for key in f.keys():
       model_dict[key] = f.get_tensor(key)

# Convert parameters to float32 + load
float_model_params = {
    k: v.to(torch.float32) for k, v in model_dict.items()
}
model.dit.load_state_dict(float_model_params)

# Eval mode
model = model.eval()

# Generate images
prompts = [
    "Pirate ship trapped in a cosmic maelstrom nebula, rendered in cosmic beach whirlpool engine, volumet",
    "A illustration from a graphic novel. A bustling city street under the shine of a full moon.",
    "A giant cobra snake made from corn",
    "A fierce garden gnome warrior, clad in armor crafted from leaves and bark, brandishes a tiny sword.",
    "A capybara made of lego sitting in a realistic, natural field",
    "a close-up of a fire spitting dragon, cinematic shot.",
    "Panda mad scientist mixing sparkling chemicals, artstation"
]
images = model.generate(prompt=prompts, num_inference_steps=30, guidance_scale=5.0, seed=42)
```

## Learning in the high-noise regime

The first key idea of our work is that **low-quality images can be used to train for high-noise diffusion times**.


This is because distribution distances contract under noise. We can train a classifier to find the merging point for each sample, like below:
![](figs/classifier_probs.jpg)

or we can select the merging point for different samples heuristically if we want to avoid the classifier training/annotation.

Once we annotate our samples (dataset preprocessing step), we can launch the diffusion training where different images are used for different subsets of the diffusion times, as shown below.

![](figs/annotations.jpg)

### Synthetic data

Synthetic data can be viewed as "low-quality" versions of real samples. Hence, we can use synthetic data for certain diffusion times, borrowing the diversity of the synthetic generations without sacrificing the image quality. This is what we do for our text-to-image results.

## Learning in the low-noise regime
How about the low-noise regime of the diffusion training? As we show in the paper, for low noise the diffusion model only looks at crops to perform the denoising.




### Out of distribution images

One nice consequence of the fact that the diffusion model only looks at crops for low noise is that we can leverage crops from out-of-distribution images, as long as locally they look like they are coming from the distribution of interest.

For example, we can use crops of cats to make a generative model for dogs! Below we show the "dogness" probability for different patches for a cat image.


![](figs/dogness_of_cat_1.jpg)

As shown, some of the crops from this cat are useful for learning dog features in the low-noise regime of the diffusion.



### High-quality crops
Images that might be overall low-quality can still contain useful patches. These patches can be used to train the diffusion model in the low-noise part of the diffusion trajectory. Below, we show examples of low-quality and high-quality crops from ImageNet.
